# Pull

An opinionated Push 2 control surface for Bitwig Studio, bent around a specific live-set workflow.

Pull is based on [DrivenByMoss](https://github.com/git-moss/DrivenByMoss).

## Building and installing the extension

1. Install JDK 21 and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).
2. Run `mvn clean package` in this repo's root.
3. Copy `target/Pull.bwextension` into Bitwig Studio's extensions folder.

## Fast core test loop

Run the reloadable controller core and its shell fakes without building the Bitwig extension:

```bash
mvn -pl pull-core -am test
```

After that first run has downloaded the test dependencies, repeat fully offline:

```bash
mvn -o -pl pull-core -am test
```

This loop uses deterministic fake time and does not launch or require Bitwig.
